IMPORTANT:

1. Add at least two devices after signing up for Testflight below.
2. If you share Earshot with a friend, sign in and add their device under your account.

Apple limits us to 100 devices at a time, so we're sending out builds in batches. Adding multiple devices under your account means that all of those devices will get access at the same time. If you want to add a friend, make sure to sign in (on their device) with your Testflight account and add their device under your own account, instead of having them create their own Testflight account. We'll see the additional devices being added to your account, and we'll make sure you both get Earshot at the same time. We wish this were simpler, too.

Supported devices: iPhone 4S and later, 3rd-gen iPad and later, iPad Mini, 5th-gen iPod touch.

Enjoy!
